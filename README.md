Installation
============

## Gitpod

By using Gitpod, you can skip all the steps which automatically installs all the necessary dependencies and builds the code.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/realstealthninja/texto)

## Locally

1. Clone the Git repository and its submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/realstealthninja/texto.git
```

2. Install dependencies (Unix/Linux).

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ninja-build libopencv-dev
```

> **Note:**
>
> Ninja Build and OpenCV are also available for MacOs and Windows. Check out their binary releases.
> <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases>
> <https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases>

3. Build with CMake.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -S ./ -B ./cmake-build-release
cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target texto -j 1
```

Currently, Texto does not offer a prebuilt package. but it doesn't take a lot to compile.\
You can also run `build.sh`, which runs the exact same commands above.

Usage
=====

```bash
./texto <PATH-TO-FILE> <COLOURSPACE>
```
